# CTWChallenge
### Code challenge by CriticalTechWorks Architected and developed by Marcelo Antunes 05/2019

This app was develop with MVVM+C with RxSwift. The app has several dependencies (Domain, Data, Data_Network, Data_ Realm).

Some inspiration -> https://github.com/sergdort/CleanArchitectureRxSwift (Some classes "taken" from there)

Domain:
Core objects and protocols

Data:
Implementation of Domain protocols. "Business logic"

Data_Network:
Calls to "HERE" services are implement here

Data_Realm:
Database implementation. Realm on this case


### Important thing: I don't have any more time left and Xcode keeps annoying me (or i am just too tired) with several errors regarding the unit testing target (Data_NetworkTests). I will leave the scheme and the target just to prove that i know how to perform unit testing. Thanks and sorry for leaving the unit testing for last
